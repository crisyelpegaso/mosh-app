***************************************
	IMPORTANT
***************************************

This project was started in Eclipse ADT. In Android Studio you need to import it as a Eclipse ADT project and it will generate a copy with IntelliJ project structure.
This needs to be changed, to support Android Studio properly.

***************************************
	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Nowadays it uses API Level 22 (Android 5.1, Lollipop release).
The minimum version supported is Level 11 (Android 3.0, Honey Comb release).
It uses internet connection to communicate with mosh server [SERVER CONFIGURATION MUST BE OUTSIDE THE CODE, THIS MUST BE MODIFIED]


************************************
	Main Activities
************************************

FeaturedActity : main activity, is created when the application starts. It displays all featured and recommended bands.
SearchActivity : activity with text input to search a particular band or concert name.
ResultsActivity : displays results brought by SearchActivity.
ConcertActivity : shows details and description of a particular concert selected.


************************************
	Layouts
************************************

Every activity has a layout assigned with the same name. i.e : SearchActivity uses a search.xml file layout.
To describe layout of item in a list view it uses the layout files list_${activityName}.xml. [THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST PRACTICE, SHOULD BE CHANGED]
